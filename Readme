# "Mouse Mouse Me" web project README

1. Project Overview
"Mouse Me" is a web design project that presents content from a unique perspective, aiming to provide users with a fun and story-filled browsing experience, through the homepage introduction, interpretation experience display, photo and message interaction, and login registration function, to create a unique "mouse" world.

2. Web structure and function

### Introduction to the home page
- When users open the web page, the first thing they see is the theme page of "Mouse Mouse Me Ah", accompanied by the song "Mouse Mouse me Ah" that automatically plays, creating a unique atmosphere and allowing users to quickly immerse themselves in this personalized theme.
- The home page presents the core concepts and general direction of the project in a clear and concise layout, using vivid text and image elements to attract users to further explore the content of the page.

### Acting experience
- This page displays a variety of interpretive stories and processes related to "Mouse" in detail, and vividly presents the life, growth, adventure and other experiences of "Mouse" to users through a combination of pictures and images, so that users can deeply understand the world of "Mouse" and enhance the emotional connection between users and the web content.

### Photo page
- Display a series of carefully selected "mouse" photos in a variety of styles, including cute, funny, warm and other different types, to meet users' diversified appreciation needs for "mouse" images. Users can perform simple interactive operations on the photo page, such as clicking to zoom in to view photo details, swiping left and right to browse different photos, etc.

### Message page
- Provide a platform for users to communicate and interact. Users can leave their love for "Mousie", their stories related to "Mousie" or suggestions and opinions on the website in the message area. At the same time, users can also view other users' messages, promoting communication between users and the formation of a sense of community.

### Login page
- Login and registration functions are set up on separate pages to ensure the security and privacy of user information. By registering an account, users can enjoy more personalized features, such as saving favorite photos and participating in specific interactive activities. After logging in, users can more easily manage their personal information and operations on the page.

### Search bar
- There is a search bar at the top of the page, and its link directly points to Baidu search, which facilitates users to search and query external information at any time in the process of browsing the page, broadens the channels for users to obtain information, and improves the practicality of the page and user experience.
